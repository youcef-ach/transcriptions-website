    " A dictator without elections.  Modestly successful comedian.  President Zelensky talked the United States of America  into spending $350 billion to go into a war  that basically couldn't be won,  that never had to start and never would have started  if I was president.  On top of this, Zelensky admits that half of the money  that we sent them is missing.  They don't know where the money is, he said.  He refuses to have elections, is low in the real Ukrainian polls.  I mean, how can you be high when every city is being demolished?  They look like a demolition site, every single one of them.  And the only thing he was really good at was playing Joe Biden like a fiddle.  He played him like a fiddle.  That's a dictator without elections.  Zelensky better move fast or he's not going to have a country left.  Got to move.  Got to move fast because that war is going in the wrong direction.  Thank you for watching.",
